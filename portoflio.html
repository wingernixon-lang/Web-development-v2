<h3><span class="fade-in-image">I was born in New Zealand, on Waiheke Island (An island off the coast of auckland) on the </span> 
<span class="fade-in-image">19th of September, 2009. I was a cheeky little bugger as a kid, and annoyed a lot of my </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">neighbours. Some might still consider me a cheeky little bugger but im much older now, and </span> 
<span class="fade-in-image">much less frantic and cheeky. Growing up, I played a lot of rugby, but I never enjoyed it that</span> 
<span class="fade-in-image">much. I started playing basketball in year 8 and I still do to this day, so that usually keeps</span>
 <span class="fade-in-image">my health up. Gym is also a big thing for me, as I go quite often and I have also started a bit</span>
<span class="fade-in-image"> of martial arts. I found passion in web development last year during my half year Digital</span>
 <span class="fade-in-image">Media class, and I have never stopped enjoying website development. </span><h3>

<h3><span class="fade-in-image">I am wishing to continue my skills in website development by taking digital media next year with my course selection, </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">alongside computer science to implement more script into my websites. After school, im planning to study digital technologies </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">in college, and then work for a company in website development. I may also choose to start my own buisness with web design </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">and design websites for various companys. Over the next few years, I am hoping to increase my skills with web design, </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">creating more and more complex and better looking websites. I find creativity one of the greatest human features, </span>
<span class="fade-in-image">as it powers most of the amazing designs in the world. Statues, art and everything inbetween. </span><h3>
